# BitDust States

BitDust project is developed on the principles of [automata-based programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/automata-based_programming) and [open project documentation movement](http://is.ifmo.ru/english/).
Learn more about that from [BitDust Wiki](https://bitdust.io/wiki/automats.html).

This repo stores Microsoft Visio vector files with transition graphs for all BitDust finite state machines.

Also, we store copies in PNG and PDF format for each .vsd file here.

Please contact us if you have any questions about how to use State Machines in your development. You can also learn how to use the [visio2python](https://github.com/vesellov/visio2python) tool to "paint & run" your program in a few steps.
